=head1 NAME

Task::Git::Repository - Install all Git::Repository plugins at once

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    cpan Task::Git::Repository

    cpanp -i Task::Git::Repository

    cpanm Task::Git::Repository

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Git::Repository> is a Git wrapper for Perl with a deliberately very
simple interface of only two main methods. The details of the Git commands
to be run are defined in the parameters to these methods.

Being so simple, L<Git::Repository> lacks a lot of methods that of its
users might find desirable. This is where L<Git::Repository::Plugin>
comes into play. It allows one to consume plugins (some would say I<Roles>)
to extend its capabilities.

=head1 CONTENTS

L<Git::Repository> - Perl interface to Git repositories

L<Git::Repository::Plugin::AUTOLOAD> - Git subcommands as L<Git::Repository> methods
