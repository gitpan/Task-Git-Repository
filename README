NAME

    Task::Git::Repository - Install all Git::Repository plugins at once

DESCRIPTION

    Git::Repository is a Git wrapper for Perl with a deliberately very
    simple interface of only two main methods. The details of the Git
    commands to be run are defined in the parameters to these methods.

    Being so simple, Git::Repository lacks a lot of methods that of its
    users might find desirable. This is where Git::Repository::Plugin comes
    into play. It allows one to consume plugins (some would say Roles) to
    extend its capabilities.
